Datasets and Descriptions: 

Overview: As people who hate water, the worst county is one where it is easist to drown to death or to even see water, meaning the best neighborhood is the most dry one. We have found the neighborhood that fellow thalassaphobiacs should avoid. 

## Worst Neighborhood
According to the City Pools csv, South Side Flats and Highland Park are the worst neighborhoods because they both contain 2 pools, Which means you are 2 times more likely to encounter a pool than you would in a neighborhood with 0 pools.
